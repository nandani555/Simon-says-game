# Simon-says-game

A web-based implementation of the classic **Simon** memory game, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Players follow an ever-growing sequence of colored buttons—can you remember and replicate the pattern? Each successful round increases the sequence length and your level. The game also tracks your all-time High Score in browser storage.
